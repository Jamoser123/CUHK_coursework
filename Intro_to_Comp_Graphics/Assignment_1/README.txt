Introduction:
The Egyptian gods have been very displeased with humans recently. As a result, they have chosen to paint the sky blood-red and afflict humanity with plagues unless they resume their worship of the gods. In order to appease the gods and avert the plagues, humans have decided to construct a massive pyramid. However, there are also atheists among the humans who are attempting to sabotage their efforts. As the pyramid grows in size, the color of the sky transitions to a beautiful blue, signifying the gods' approval of humankind's progress.

General Manipulation:
"Esc": Exit

Pyramid Manipulation:
"W": Allows humans to work on the pyramid. Pressing "W" increases the pyramid's size and changes the sky to a slightly bluer hue.
"D": Enables atheists to damage the pyramid. Pressing "D" decreases the pyramid's size and returns the sky to a redder color.

Worker Manipulation:
"J": Moves the worker to the right.
"L": Moves the worker to the left.
"I": Rotates the worker to the right.
"K": Rotates the worker to the left.

Camera Perspective Manipulation:
"Scroll-Y": Adjusts the camera's y-coordinate position.

More Information on the Project:
The worker's design draws inspiration from the proportions found in Minecraft. Comprising five boxes, this design allows for the reuse of indices and shortens the code for rendering.

The pyramid features a square base and four triangles of equal size as its sides.

The ground is represented as a large plane.

The color of the sky changes in relation to the pyramid's size.

There are limitations on the size of the pyramid and the worker's movement plane.

The project incorporates perspective projection and depth concepts from the slides.

Grading:
1. Draw at least two 3D objects: Pyramid, Worker
2. At least one object is drawn with indexing: Pyramid, Worker
3. Incorporate at least three types of keyboard and mouse events: W, D, J, L, I, K, Scroll-Y
4. Implement three types of object transformations (rotation, translation, scaling): Scaling the pyramid, translating the worker, rotating the worker
5. Utilize perspective projection: Given
6. Apply depth testing: Given

Advanced:
- Create realistic and meaningful objects and scenes using various primitives: Pyramid and Worker in an Egyptian setting.
- Implement interesting and creative interactions, such as scene interaction: Pressing "W" allows the worker to build the pyramid, while pressing "D" enables the worker to destroy it.
- Change the camera viewpoint interactively using scrolling.
